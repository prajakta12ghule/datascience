#So in our dataframe column contain 400 rows and 5 column, from taht column , we decided our dependent variable is puchased
#and from others independent variables we  wiil select only relavent column , and think that gender and user id  is not important to predict futre
# so we will delete unrelavent column during variable define , when slicing

#now build the model with train data
# call  the logistic reg function , abÂ´nd define it , then fit and train the model with your train data
# with deafault function without parameter change

# now compare the value of y_test and Ypred, how model predict
# we saww there is missclassification happen , lets try to find the how many missclassifiacation happen(false postive, false negative)
# so here come , confusion matrix , to build this confusion matrix we need to import co. matrix from sklearn.matrix
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

# can we improve this model ?
#we can try to improve the model , by test split (15%, 20%), we can also imperove by feature scaling by normalizatin or minmax scaler
#we can also try to improve wtth parameter tuning inLR function#Lets try
